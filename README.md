# Food_Inspection_MH-Hackathon


The food inspection department conducts regular inspection on food quality for various restaurants in the city Chicago. 
Itâ€™s a very well documented procedure and over time some good amount of data has been generated out of these inspections. 

The inspection department would like to predict where they should focus most in terms of their next inspection schedule, so that they can most optimize their time at hand to 
catch the worst offenders. Can the past inspection or any data that they have collected predict which facility will pass or fail.

In this hackathon, MachineHack provides you with a subset of this dataset with information on food quality checks conducted on thousands of facilities that serve food
across multiple cities. In this project I aim to build a  predictive model that is capable of predicting the outcome of an inspection conducted in a facility based on the given 
set of features using machine learning and deep learning.
